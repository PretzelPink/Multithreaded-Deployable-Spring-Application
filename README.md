Project Summary
-----------------
Students write multithreaded object-oriented code using Java frameworks and determine how to deploy software applications using cloud services.
Students will modify a Spring application with a Java back end and an Angular front end to include multithreaded language translation, a message at different time zones, and currency exchange. Then, build a Docker image of the current multithreaded Spring application and containerize it using the supporting documents provided in this task.

In this project I edited an existing mock hotel reservation website where I added currency translation (US Dollars, CA Dollars, Euros), time translation based on the time zone that displayed a unique time for each user, and lastly the addition of multithreading to a simple message display that would display two messages at different times (utilized race conditions)
